# Master thesis

## Description

This project is part of a master thesis focused on detecting malicious network behavior. The primary goal is to develop a proactive defense mechanism against advanced persistent threats (APTs) by analyzing user log data, which includes URLs, hostnames, timestamps, and IP addresses. The project leverages various data analysis techniques to identify patterns indicative of malicious activities, such as beaconing behavior.
